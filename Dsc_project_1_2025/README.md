Aircraft Risk Analysis & Business Recommendations.

Project Overview

This project analyzes aviation accident data to assess risks associated with different aircraft models, makes, and flight phases. The goal is to provide data-driven recommendations for a company looking to expand into the aviation industry while minimizing operational risks.

Key Objectives

Identify aircraft models and makes associated with the highest number of accidents and casualties.

Examine the relationship between weather conditions and accident rates.

Analyze which phases of flight are most prone to accidents.

Provide actionable business recommendations to mitigate risk.

Data Science Workflow

Data Collection: The dataset consists of aviation accident records with details such as aircraft model, make, weather conditions, phase of flight, and casualties.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Handled missing values and inconsistencies.

Standardized column names for consistency.

Removed outliers where necessary.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized accident trends by model, make, and country.

Investigated the impact of weather on accidents.

Analyzed casualties in different flight phases.

Visualization & Insights:

Created impactful visualizations using Tableau and Matplotlib.

Highlighted risk factors for aircraft selection.

Business Recommendations:

Suggested the safest aircraft models based on data.

Identified high-risk flight phases for operational awareness.

Provided strategies for mitigating weather-related risks.
